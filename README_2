As the owner of this organization, I would like to mention that this group is to be treated like the workplace. 
Everyone will be treated as adults, and will be responsible for their work. I look forward to working with everyone.

Directions for github:
-To make changes to a document, click on the file you want to edit.
  -Go to the top right of the page where it says "branch"
  -Click that and type in the bar that appears the name of a new "folder" you want the edited document to be stored in. 
    This will make a copy of the original file to ensure that the main file does not get corrupted.
  -Once you have done this, you may then edit the page to your content.
  -When you are finished with a file and have tested it, 
    go back to the "master" branch in the dropdown menu at the top right and add the finished product into that version.
