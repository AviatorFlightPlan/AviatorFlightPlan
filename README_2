Greetings, we would like to welcome everyone to the Aviator Flight Plan Team. 
If you are looking at this page, you must be new to the team or to GitHub.
Here, we will provide instructions on how to use GitHub.
We are committed to keeping this experience as close to how a workplace would be as possible,
so keep your work professional.


Good Luck!
Project Managers,
Ben Cohen and Griffin Ramsey

Directions for github:

-If you have not already, create a GitHub account. There should be a link somewhere at the top right of GitHub.com.
-Next, unless you've already done so, ask a project manager for access to the files.

Now you are ready to download GitHub.
-First, install GitHub to your computer. Choose the correct link for your system.
Windows: https://windows.github.com/
Mac: https://mac.github.com/
Linux: This is a bit complicated if you're used to using a non-linux machine.
-Open the terminal (For most versoins of linux, the hotkey is Ctrl + Alt + T).
-In the terminal, type sudo apt-get install git
-Press enter and now type git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
-Press enter again and also type git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"

Now we can start learning how to use GitHub
-Go back to the repository page on the GitHub website (https://github.com/AviatorFlightPlan/AviatorFlightPlan) 
    and go to the top right corner where it says "fork"
-Click that and then click on the square that appears for your username.
This will create a version just for you so you dont have to worry about ruining the original.
-Now go to the bottom right corner and click "clone in desktop"
-Now that you have GitHub installed and cloned the files, 
    look for a program that should have installed with GitHub called Git Shell, or something similar.
-Once that opens, find your folder that you just cloned. 
    Mine was located at C:\Users\MYNAME\Documents\GitHub\AviatorFlightPlan
-Copy the location you found your folder in and go into the Git Shell you opened earlier.
-Now type cd FOLDER_LOCATION_YOU_JUST_COPIED
What that just did was allow the program to know where to look when editing your files.
-If you did not press enter, please press enter, and from now on, 
    always just assume to press enter after typing something into this program.
-Next, type git init
This initializes your repository so that you can work with it.
-Once you do that, type git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/AviatorFlightPlan
This allows you to upload changes to the online copy of the repository.

You now have GitHub set up and you can now begin to push/pull/change files.

At the start of each session, you must do these:
-Make sure you are in the correct directory. If you are not sure, just type cd FOLDER_LOCATION
(Mine is C:\Users\MYNAME\Documents\GitHub\AviatorFlightPlan) I've also found just typing cd AviatorFlightPlan works.
-Make sure you are in the branch you want to be working on. For more info about branches keep reading.
-type git pull
This will allow you to have all the current changes people have uploaded and initialize your files for the session.

To use Github:
-To add a new file to the repository, put the file in the folder location you specified a few steps above, 
    then type git add FILE_NAME
Or: to add every file in your folder, type git add *
-To check if your file has been uploaded online, type git status
Files that are not uploaded will be listed.
-To save a changelog, type git commit -m "TYPE_CHANGES_HERE"
Or: if you have a longer message type, git commit
This will bring up a long message. Just start typing your message and 
    then just close and save the box that appeared when you are done.
*You must do a commit command before you can upload online.
-To upload all your files type git push
-To download the latest files from online, type git pull
-To switch branches, type git checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH
Be careful because once you switch, all changes will be made to that new branch you switched to.
-To see what branches exist locally, type git branch
-To merge the currently viewed branch and another, type git merge BRANCH_NAME
*Tip: For this to work correctly, switch to viewing the branch you want to have data merged to,
    then use the above command with the BRANCH_NAME being the branch that you want give data to the other branch.
-To push your local branch online, type git push origin BRANCH_NAME
If you don't know what a branch is, 
    basically it is a version of a program stored in a separate place than the original version so you don't corrupt files, 
    or so you can try out features without ruining the original.
    
**Once you push an update online, you are not done.
-By using the push command using the setting you set up through this tutorial, 
    you are only pushing changes to your personal online copy.
-Now you need to push it to the main copy which is controlled by the project managers.
-To do this, go to the website (github/YOUR_USER/AviatorFlightPlan) 
    and look towards the center right of the screen for the link "pull request"
-At the new screen, make sure the box at the top right says AviatorFlightPlan/AviatorFlightPlan,
    and the box next to it says YOUR_USER_NAME/AviatorFlightPlan
-Now you can use this page to create a request for a manager to add your changes to the official version.
