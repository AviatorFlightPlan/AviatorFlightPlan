As the owner of this organization, I would like to mention that this group is to be treated like the workplace. 
Everyone will be treated as adults, and will be responsible for their work. I look forward to working with everyone.

Directions for github:
-To make changes to a document, click on the file you want to edit.
  -Go to the top right of the page where it says "branch"
  -Click that and type in the bar that appears the name of a new "folder" you want the edited document to be stored in. 
    This will make a copy of the original file to ensure that the main file does not get corrupted.
  -Once you have done this, you may then edit the page to your content.
  -When you are finished with a file and have tested it, 
    go back to the "master" branch in the dropdown menu at the top right and add the finished product into that version.

When you are done for the day, go to the wiki (located here: https://github.com/AviatorFlightPlan/AviatorFlightPlan/wiki ) 
  and follow the instructions there to make a change log. Please keep up with your change logs, 
  they are important for tracking our progress.
