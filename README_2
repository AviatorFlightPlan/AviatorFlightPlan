As the owner of this organization, I would like to mention that this group is to be treated like the workplace. 
Everyone will be treated as adults, and will be responsible for their work. I look forward to working with everyone.

Directions for github:
-To make changes to a document, click on the file you want to edit.
  -Go to the top right of the page where it says "branch"
  -Click that and choose patch1.0 from the dropdown menu,
    which I have created as a file we can all edit without worrying about the main file getting corrupted.
  -Once you have done this, go to the top right of the text box and click the pencil, 
    you may then edit the page to your content.
  -When you are finished with a file and have tested it, 
    go back to the "master" branch in the dropdown menu at the top right and add the finished product into that version.

When you are done for the day, go to the wiki (located here: https://github.com/AviatorFlightPlan/AviatorFlightPlan/wiki ) 
  and follow the instructions there to make a change log. Please keep up with your change logs, 
  they are important for tracking our progress.
